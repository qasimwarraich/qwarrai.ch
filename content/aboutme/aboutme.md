Having recently completed my Master‚Äôs degree, I am excited about the next
steps. I am looking forward greatly to the opportunity to join a team where I
can continue learning and expanding my knowledge and build some cool software
along the way. In University, my work and personal interest has mostly been in
the area of computer vision and its applications in robotics. As a component of
my Master‚Äôs degree, I completed an individual study module with the [Robotics
and Perception](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) research group at UZH. This study
involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision and its application in
solving problems such as VIO, SLAM. I also completed a group project with the
[Computer Vision Laboratory](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at the ETH, in the
realm of domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation. 

What excites me the most, is working on projects that influence and play a
tangible role in the physical world. This is what attracted me to computer
vision, and its application to flying machines like drones and aircraft in
particular. My interests are however not only constrained to the world of
computer vision. Working on any kind of user-facing technology is intriguing to
me, especially when it entails some sort of physical interaction.

I am also very interested in open source software and, through my work
experience, am familiar with various web technologies. I also have a strong
personal affinity for User-Centered Design.

## I ‚ù§Ô∏è Terminals

I am a big command-line nerd. So much so that, as part of my
[Master\'s Thesis work](https://github.com/qasimwarraich/cli-tutor.git), I built a CLI tutor tool to help introduce beginners to
textual interaction and using the command-line.

A web version of the application that uses a svelte, xterm.js, docker and
websockets to serve the tool over the web is available at:
[clitutor.chistole.ch](https://clitutor.chistole.ch).

## Hobbies üö≤

I have been involved in the cycling and bicycle messenger communities since my
early teenage years. Furthermore, I am active in organising cycling events and
am a core member of an open bicycle workshop project in Bern.
