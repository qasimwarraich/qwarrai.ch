Having recently completed my Master‚Äôs degree, I am excited about the next
steps. I am looking forward greatly to the opportunity to join a team where I
can continue learning and expanding my knowledge and build some cool software
along the way. In University, my work and personal interest has mostly been in
the area of computer vision and its applications in robotics. As a component of
my Master‚Äôs degree, I completed an individual study module with the [Robotics
and Perception](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) research group at UZH. This study
involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision and its application in
solving problems such as VIO, SLAM. I also completed a group project with the
[Computer Vision Laboratory](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at the ETH, in the
realm of domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation. What excites me the
most, is working on projects that influence and play a tangible role in the
physical world. I am also very interested in open source software and, through
my work experience, am familiar with various web technologies. I also have a
strong personal affinity for User-Centered Design.


## Hobbies üö≤

I have been involved in the cycling and bicycle messenger communities since my
early teenage years. Furthermore, I am active in organising cycling events and
am a core member of an open bicycle workshop project in Bern.
