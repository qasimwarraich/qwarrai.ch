Recently, my work and personal interest has been in the area of computer vision
and its applications in robotics. As a component of my Master’s degree I
completed an individual study module with the Robotics and Perception research
group at UZH. This study involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision
and its application in solving problems such as VIO, SLAM and it’s potential in
various reconstruction algorithms. Personally what excites me the most is
working on projects that influence and play a tangible role in the physical
world. This is the primary reason I am passionate about working with computer
vision technologies and robots. Implementations such as flying machines and
autonomous robots are especially of interest to me. I also have a strong
personal affinity for User-Centered Design and especially the subtleties in the
interaction between user and interface. Factors such as the understanding the
physiological and ergonomic tendencies of users, factors such as appreciating
visual or aesthetic preferences and also the manner in which individuals
approach matters of logic and problem solving are unendingly interesting to me.
