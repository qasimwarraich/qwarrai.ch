      <description>$ whoami Recently, my work and personal interest has been in the area of computer vision and its applications in robotics. As a component of my Master’s degree I completed an individual study module with the Robotics and Perception research group at UZH. This study involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision and its application in solving problems such as VIO, SLAM and it’s potential in various reconstruction algorithms. Personally what excites me the most is working on projects that influence and play a tangible role in the physical world.</description>
