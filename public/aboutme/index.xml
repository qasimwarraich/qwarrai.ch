&lt;p&gt;Having recently completed my Master’s degree, I am excited about the next
steps. I am looking forward greatly to the opportunity to join a team where I
can continue learning and expanding my knowledge and build some cool software
along the way. In University, my work and personal interest has mostly been in
the area of computer vision and its applications in robotics. As a component of
my Master’s degree, I completed an individual study module with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robotics
and Perception&lt;/a&gt;
 research group at UZH. This study
involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision and its application in
solving problems such as VIO, SLAM. I also completed a group project with the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Computer Vision Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;
 at the ETH, in the
realm of domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
