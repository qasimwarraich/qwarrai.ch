Having recently completed my Master‚Äôs degree, I am excited about the next
steps. I am looking forward greatly to the opportunity to join a team where I
can continue learning and expanding my knowledge and build some cool software
along the way. In University, my work and personal interest has mostly been in
the area of computer vision and its applications in robotics. As a component of
my Master‚Äôs degree, I completed an individual study module with the Robotics
and Perception
 research group at UZH. This study
involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision and its application in
solving problems such as VIO, SLAM. I also completed a group project with the
Computer Vision Laboratory
 at the ETH, in the
realm of domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation.">

<p>Having recently completed my Master‚Äôs degree, I am excited about the next
steps. I am looking forward greatly to the opportunity to join a team where I
can continue learning and expanding my knowledge and build some cool software
along the way. In University, my work and personal interest has mostly been in
the area of computer vision and its applications in robotics. As a component of
my Master‚Äôs degree, I completed an individual study module with the <a href="https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/" target="_blank">Robotics

involved gaining familiarity with Event-Based Vision and its application in
solving problems such as VIO, SLAM. I also completed a group project with the
